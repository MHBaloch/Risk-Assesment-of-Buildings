# Risk-Assesment-of-Buildings

Research Topic: 
Post Earthquake assessment of buildings to know the buildings least and most stable.

Task: 
To prepare a research report outlining the importance of dataset and the analysis 
that can be performed and how it will be useful for the concerned authorities.

Approach:
Creating hypothesis and research questions.
Solving the research questions to determine the results using multiple features of the 
buildings such as roof type, soil type, etc. via exploratory data analysis using pandas,
numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. Analysed hypothesis results to determine the important 
features in the buildings' data for reaching assessment conclusion.

Results:
It was assumed that new buildings are most stable, however the results proved that the
assumption is not right and buildings stability does not depend upon the buildings
age nor dependent on any single feature. It could be based on multiple features. 
Based on the analysis conducted, its clearly depicted that the tolernce to earthquake
depends upon the type of construction materials used in foundation and super structure 
with keeping in sight the land surface condition and geo level.
